# TextEditor
simple console based text editor in python it kind of sucks and i could have written somthing better 
but this was one of those 3am woke up and just started writing type things :)


The program starts on the menu()

which gives you a few options lets make a new text file using the 'new option'

after you give it a file name and press enter you will immediately be dropped into the text editing prompt

where you can edit text and see its changes live.
when your done enter the word 'menu' and press enter to re enter the menu
type in exit to exit your file and the software

you can also open and re edit files you have made or files you have.
relaunch the software and use the 'open' option and enter your text file name.
you dont need the .txt at the end the program automatically appends that to the end of your input string.
after you open the file you will be dropped into the edit prompt again and it will show the text that was in the file.
